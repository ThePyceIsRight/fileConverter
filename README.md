This is mostly a sandbox for developing custom image and video editing features so that I don't have to rely on pay-walled or low-quality solutions online.

Specific goals I want to accomplish are:
```
  1. To create a passable image/gif/video background removal tool.
  2. Image feathering tool
  3. Image recoloring with user-defined color
  4. Image negative
  5. Img/gif/video cropping to shape
  6. Gif tool suite:
    -FPS / ms per frame
    -Reverse
    -Graph speed editor
    -Smart overlays (stickers,colors,blurs,filters,etc.)
```
Eventually, a GUI would be nice so that operating on multiple images with multiple effects would be easier.
